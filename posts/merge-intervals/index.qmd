# Merge Intervals

## Definition

Merge intervals is applicable to problems that entail overlapping intervals. Each interval is represented by a start and an end time. This typically involves a scheduling problem. The best way to think about this is noticing the 3 ways 2 intervals can interact.

To reduce the number of comparisons to make, the list of intervals is usually required to be sorted. Afterwards, it is about iterating the list and compare the elements.

The pattern is usually tested by companies with system scheduling problems, such as TikTok/ByteDance. 

## Problems

### 1. Merge Intervals

#### Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
As mentioned, first, we need to sort the array. But how exactly should we sort it? The hint for me are the examples - the array there is sorted based on the start time. The problem then is about *updating the end of each interval*. If the interval with a smaller start time is 1 and the next one is 2, append 2 as is to the return array first if they are non-overlapping. If 1 envelops 2, do nothing. If 2 ends later than 1, update the entry in the return array.

The question comes to "Can I think of such a thing on my own from first principles in an interview?" I think that I can, but it may take some time. I don't think that I will encounter this problem in an interview though - if anything, it will be Merge Intervals II or Meeting Room II at least.

#### Algorithm
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Sort the input array `intervals`.
2. Initialize the return array `sorted_intervals` with the first element of the sorted input array.
3. Iterate the rest of the input array, updating or appending to the return array each time.
4. Return the result.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$O(n\log n)$: The usual time required for sorting.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$O(n)$: Python `.sort()` uses Timsort, which uses between n//2 to no extra memory (on top of the heap, which is related to heapsort, and is another matter).

> timsort can require a temp array containing as many as N//2 pointers, which means as many as 2*N extra bytes on 32-bit boxes.  It can be expected to require a temp array this large when sorting random data; on data with significant structure, it may get away without using any extra heap memory.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x:x[0]) # Not really necessary
        sorted_intervals = [intervals[0]]
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            if interval[0] > sorted_intervals[-1][1]:
                sorted_intervals.append(interval)
            else:
                sorted_intervals[-1][1] = max(interval[1], sorted_intervals[-1][1])
        return sorted_intervals
```

### 2. Insert Interval

#### Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
I got overwhelmed at first. In such a case, it is important to relax and deconstruct. Firstly, modifying the array in place is hard - it may be better to just create a new output array. Next, for any interval in the input array `intervals`, the new interval can come before it, can come after it, or overlaps with it. The first two cases are trivial, while the third case requires modification. I was just thinking about modifying the output array, *while I can modify the new interval instead.*
#### Algorithm
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize the output array `answer`.
2. Iterate the input array `intervals`. For three cases:
   1. If the new interval comes after the current one, append it to `answer` and return.
   2. If the new interval comes before the current one, append the current one to `answer`.
   3. Else, update new interval with the earlier start time and the later end time between the new interval and the current one.
3. Append the new interval into the output array and return.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$O(n)$: We need to iterate the input array once.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$O(n)$: We need to store the output array. If it is not counted as part of the extra memory used, it is $O(1)$.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        answer = []

        for i in range(len(intervals)):
            # Easy case: newInterval is non-overlapping the rest
            if newInterval[1] < intervals[i][0]:
                answer.append(newInterval)
                return answer + intervals[i:]
            elif newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]:
                answer.append(intervals[i])
            else:
                newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]),
                               max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])]
        
        answer.append(newInterval)
        return answer
```

### 3. Meeting Rooms

#### Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Welcome to the Meeting Room series! This is a big series much tested by TikTok in merge intervals. The requirement is completing at least Meeting Rooms II. For this series, I use a different platform called [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com/). It allows access to premium questions for free under certain circumstances.

For the problem, it is straightforward. The person cannot attend the meetings if the end time of one is after the start time of another. Hence, if we sort the input array according to the start time, we can iterate and compare two adjacent arrays. If we encounter an overlapping pair, we return `False`. If we reach the end, we return `True`. 

#### Algorithm
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Iterate the input array `intervals`, one adjacent pair at a time.
2. If we encounter an overlapping, return `False`.
3. If we reach the end, return `True`.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$O(n)$: We need to iterate the input array once.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$O(1)$: We do not use any extra memory.

#### Code
```python
from typing import (
    List,
)
from lintcode import (
    Interval,
)

        for i in range(len(intervals)-1):
            if intervals[i].end > intervals[i+1].start:
                return False
        return True
