# Tree

## Definitions

The upgraded version of a linked list.

- It is acyclic (doesn't contain any cycles);
- There exists a path from the root to any node;
- Has $N - 1$ edges, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the tree; and
- Each node has exactly one parent node with the exception of the root node.
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
