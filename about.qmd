# About this blog

This blog is mostly for my own study of data structures and algorithms and LeetCode questions. Therefore, it lacks the normal structure of a study resource for audience, especially for the LeetCode questions mentioned. There will be no problem statements, constraints, etc., only notes on intuition, approach, and code solutions with comments. Please open the corresponding LeetCode/LintCode questions while reading.
